    <h2>Incredients</h2>
    Chicken wings – Use fresh or thawed frozen wings that are broken down into drumettes and wingettes <br>
Baking powder – The secret ingredient for getting your chicken wings ultra-crispy without the need for deep frying <br>
Salt – we use fine sea salt in nearly all of our cooking<br><br>
Garlic powder – adds a bit of zest to your wings before tossing them in the buffalo sauce 
Unsalted butter – adds a nice creaminess to the buffalo sauce <br>
Frank’s Original Red Hot Sauce – This is the perfect base for your wing sauce. It’s tangy, a little sweet, and has just the right amount of spiciness.<br>
Sugar – helps the sauce caramelize and thicken on your piping hot wings<br>
    <h2>Way of Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Prep Chicken Wings – cut wings in half to separate the drums from the wingettes. Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat the oven and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over the pan.</li>
       <li>Make dry seasoning – Combine baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. </li>
<li>Season the wings – Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them in the dry seasoning until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.</li>
<li>Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway.</li>

<li>Make the Buffalo Sauce – In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.</li>
<li>Toss Wings in Sauce – Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, drizzle with sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
