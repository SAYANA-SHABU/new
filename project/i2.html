To cook the dosa
Melted ghee

    <h2><u>Methode</u></h2>
    Place the urad dhal, chana dhal and methi seeds in a large bowl. Rinse them well several times by rubbing them between the hands. Drain and cover with plenty of room temperature water.
In another large bowl, add the Sona Masoori rice and idli rice and rinse them well several times, rubbing them between the hands, then cover them with plenty of water at room temperature.
Leave the contents of the two bowls to ferment for 5 hours.
Thirty minutes before the end of the soaking of the two bowls, rinse the poha twice and place it in a bowl. Pour in enough water to submerge it completely and let it soak for 30 minutes.
In a fine colander, drain the seeds of urad dhal, chana dhal and methi. Also drain the poha and place them in the bowl of a blender.
Pour over the 1¼ cup (300 ml) of water at room temperature and the salt.
Mix everything until getting a thick, fluffy and smooth paste.
Transfer the resulting batter into a large bowl. Set aside.
Drain the rice completely. Pour them into the blender then add ½ cup (120 ml) of water at room temperature. Blend the mixture until slightly coarse or smooth to taste. If necessary, add around 2 tablespoons (20 ml) of water while mixing.
Pour the rice mixture into the previously mixed and reserved dhal paste and mix well with a spatula.
The resulting mixture should be very smooth and creamy. Let the batter ferment in a warm place for about 10 hours. It should be thicker than a classic pancake batter, but still pourable.
Potato masala
Boil or steam the peeled and diced potatoes until just barely cooked. Do not cook them until they are mushy. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.
Then add the cumin, mustard, chana dhal and urad dhal.
Sauté until the dhals turn golden.
Then add the onions, curry leaves and peppers. Mix and brown, stirring regularly, until the onions turn lightly golden.
Add asafoetida and ginger and sauté until the ginger aroma emerges.
Add the potatoes to the pan. Add the turmeric, salt, and the 3 tablespoons of hot water. Sauté over high heat, stirring for 3 minutes.
Add the cilantro leaves. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
Cooking
Bring the batter to the desired consistency if necessary, adding a little water. It should have a thick consistency that can be poured and spread.
Heat a dosa tawa or a cast iron skillet over medium heat.
When it gets slightly hot, pour a few drops of melted ghee over it and spread it with half an onion stuck in the prongs of a fork.
When the skillet is hot enough, stir the batter and take a full ladle.
Pour the batter in the center of the tawa or skillet.
Immediately start spreading it out in a circular motion starting from the center, continue clockwise, making circles until reaching the edges of the pan.
Make thick or thin dosas, according to taste. If the batter is difficult to spread, it means it is too thick or the pan is too hot. In this case, add a little water or lower the heat.
Drizzle a little melted ghee on the edges of the dosa and also all over the dosa. Cook the dosa over medium heat.
As soon as the edges are raised. Flip and cook the other side for just 1 minute.
Place the potato masala on half of the dosa.
Fold it or roll it up.
