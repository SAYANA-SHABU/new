    <h2><u>Incredients</u></h2>
    The spicy sauce coats the soft cubes of silken tofu, tasty bits of ground pork, scallion, and Sichuan (or Szechuan) peppercorns.
    <h2><u>Methode</u></h2>
    Some peppercorns are lower quality and come with a bitter black seed. Definitely avoid those! The husk is where the flavor is.
The second cause for bitterness is accidentally burning your Sichuan peppercorns during the frying process. Err on the side of caution there—we’ve updated the recipe to add the peppercorns in after the cooked pork is already in the wok (see Step 2 of the recipe card).
At some point, more peppercorns, yes, will result in a stronger numbing sensation (which we know some of you all are junkies for), but can also give the dish a stronger more herbal and bitter undertone. If you want a milder Sichuan peppercorn flavor, you can start off with as little as 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon.
