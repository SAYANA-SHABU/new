    <h2><u>Methode</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the water.</li>
        <li>Add 150 to 200 grams noodles. No need to break them. Here I have used hakka noodles. But you can use whole wheat noodles, soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) or chowmein noodles or ramen noodles.

        </li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Allow the noodles to cook until tender and softened. You don’t need to cook the noodles al dente as later we only toss the noodles with the stir-fried veggies and do not cook them further. But if you prefer, you can cook them until al dente.

        </li>
        <li>Drain the cooked noodles in a colander.Rinse the noodles very well under running water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li> Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to the noodles. You can also use any neutral-flavored oil.</li>
        <li>Toss them well so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles to prevent them from sticking together. Cover and keep the noodles aside</li>

        <li>While the noodles are cooking, chop and grate the veggies. Also chop the button mushrooms. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Prepare cornflour (aka cornstarch) slurry with 2 teaspoons cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Keep aside.

            corn starch paste in red measuring cup</li>
        <li>Heat 2.5 to 3 tablespoons of oil in a pan or wok on medium heat. You can use any neutral-flavored oil.</li>
