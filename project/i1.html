    <li>Whisk the dahi well until obtaining a smooth consistency. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Wipe off any moisture on the curry leaves and fry them in the still hot chicken vegetable oil.
    </li>
    <li>Drain on paper towels and set aside.Heat a pan with 1 tablespoon of oil.Add the cumin, mustard, garlic, curry leaves and green hot peppers.</li>
    <li>Brown them, stirring frequently, until the curry leaves become crisp.Then add the garlic paste, garam masala, red pepper flakes, sugar, dahi (or 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of water), and salt.</li>
    <li>Mix everything together quickly and, when the mixture is bubbling and becomes thick, add the fried chicken and mix well.</li>
    <li>Sauté over medium heat until chicken absorbs all the moisture, no more than 2 minutes. More time would make the chicken tough.</li>
