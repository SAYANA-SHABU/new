    <p><b>Ingredients</b><br>
        2 limes, juiced<br>
        
        2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
        
        2 tablespoons fajita seasoning<br>
        
        1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves<br>
        
        2 large yellow bell peppers<br>
        
        2 large red bell peppers<br>
        
       
        
      <b>  Directions</b><br>
        Whisk lime juice, olive oil, and fajita seasoning together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
        
        Chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag with a marinade inside. 
       
        Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
        
        Cut bell peppers in half and discard inner membranes and seeds.
        
        Overhead of a red and a yellow bell pepper being cut in half on a cutting board. 
        
        Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
        
        Place chicken and peppers (cut-side down) on the preheated grill. Cook, turning occasionally until chicken is no longer pink in center, juices run clear, and peppers have nice grill marks on them, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
