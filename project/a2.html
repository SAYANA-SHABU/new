    <h1>Banana split</h1>

    <h2>Incredients</h2>
    2 cups (288 grams) vanilla ice cream<br>
1 banana, peeled and sliced<br>
½ cup (120 milliliters) milk<br>
½ teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
Hot fudge, maraschino cherry and whipped cream, for garnish<br>
Sprinkles, for garnish (optional)<br>
<h2>Way of Process</h2>
*Place the banana into a long, narrow dish. If you have not already, peel the banana, then slice it in half lengthwise. Place the banana into a long, narrow dish, with the curved ends pointing up.
You can buy dishes made specifically for banana splits.<br>*Place three scoops of ice cream down the middle, between the banana halves. One scoop each of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream is the most traditional. Another popular choice is all vanilla ice cream.<br>*
Drizzle the sauces and toppings on top of the ice cream. If you want to get really traditional, pour the chocolate sauce on top of the chocolate ice cream, the strawberry sauce on top of strawberry, and the pineapple on top of the vanilla. Alternatively, you can pour chocolate sauce over each scoop of ice cream.
