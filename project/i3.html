    <h1>PANEER</h1>

    <h2><u>Incredients</u></h2>
    6 cups fresh whole buffalo milk (or cow&#39;s milk)<br>
3 tablespoons vinegar (or organic lemon juice)<br>
<u>Equipment</u><br>
Colander<br>
Large fine-mesh cheesecloth<br>
Large bowl (to collect the whey)<br>
2 heavy objects
    <h2><u>Methode</u></h2>
    Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed, non-stick saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
Stir occasionally to make sure the milk does not burn at the bottom.
Meanwhile, place a colander on a large bowl to collect the whey.
Spread a large, fine-mesh cheesecloth over the colander.
When the milk comes to a boil, turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar or lemon juice.
Stir well for 1 to 2 minutes until all the milk is completely curdled. The milk solids start to separate from the whey. The whey will no longer be milky but will be clear.
If the milk does not curdle completely, turn on the heat and re-boil the milk over medium heat until all the milk curdles. Turn off the heat as soon as it curdles as continuing to cook at this point could make the paneer hard.
Gently pour the whole paneer with the whey over the cheesecloth in the colander. Immediately pour very cold water over it to stop the paneer from cooking.
Then rinse it under cold running water to remove the smell and taste of vinegar or lemon.
Wring out the cheesecloth, giving the paneer a round shape.
Squeeze out any excess whey or water.
Tie a knot and hang the cheesecloth for 30 minutes to allow excess whey to drain.
Untie the knot and twist the edges of the cheesecloth.
Place the cheesecloth with the paneer on a flat colander or wooden board. Press on it and place 2 heavy objects on it. Example: Place a heavy saucepan on the paneer and place 1 package of rice or pulses weighing about 5 lb (2 to 3 kg) inside the pan.
After 4 hours, remove the heavy objects and the cheesecloth, and cut the paneer into cubes.
Refrigerate the paneer and store for 2 to 3 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.
