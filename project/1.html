    <p>Cooking is a need for one and all and everyone must learn how to cook to make their lives easier. Cooking is the skill of making food by making use of many ingredients. Cooking can be done through various methods like boiling, grilling, sauteing, etc. It is not clearly known when did our ancestors started to cook but studies show that they began Cooking using fire some million years ago. Cooking is required to make the food items edible and healthy. Cooking is also an art as the cook is using all his abilities to prepare a masterpiece in itself that is fit for consumption by a human being. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary from region to region and person to person. In early times clay pots were used for cooking on open fire. Cooking makes it more tasty and presentable, more easier to digest, and kills the bacteria present in the raw ingredients.</p>
    <p>The convenience of fast food has made people forget the benefits of cooking food at home. Yes, it is true that Cooking is a time consuming and difficult process but it has some fun values also especially if our family, kids come and help us in the kitchen. It increases the bonding and love between a family as the more we spend time with each other the more we become close to each and everyone. Cooking at home is a lifestyle followed by many health influences also as they make people aware about its benefits. Therefore we must encourage our children and teenagers to learn Cooking and improvise their cooking skills.</p>
    <p>Cooking is a necessity for all of us but some also follow it as a profession. But according to our society Cooking is only meant for females, which is wrong. Nowadays it is a requirement for both the genders as it makes us independent and also we can support our family in difficult times. It is a source of pleasure and satisfaction for some people. Cooking like other subjects should be a part of your curriculum. In this way children will get to learn the importance of it which will be helpful to them in their near future. It is a good productive activity as it includes the use of both mind and body. It is a kind of stress buster for someone. We all have seen our mothers, grandmothers and sisters Cooking in the kitchen and that too in the most loving way. But the introduction of fast food has changed the basic concept of cooking. It is human tendency to incline towards the things which need less or no effort. Fast food is one of them, no second thoughts that they are not good for our health.</p>
